INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================

To get started you need to download CoinSite main package from https://github.com/DisasterFaster/CoinSite/. The package includes the core of the platform and some additional modules (called plugins), such as Photo Uploading, Video Sharing, Instant Chat, Forum and Blogs. Every plugin can be enabled/disabled in the admin panel.
Upload unpacked package with an FTP client, type http://www.mycommunity/install/ in your browser, and follow instructions.
CoinSite core has numerous options, which allow site-specific configuration. In addition to predefined plugins, there are also many original and third-party plugins for extended functionality, not included in the main package.

APPEARANCE
==========

The visual appearance of a CoinSite-powered site is defined by a selected theme (themes are extensions that set siteâ€™s fonts, color scheme, and layout). CoinSite default package includes several standard themes, with more themes available for download. Users can also create their own custom themes. Themes can be customized via the Admin Panel, using simple customization interface. Additional theme customization can be done with an FTP client.
